# API-Wiki


Personal exercise for the implementation of a wikipedia API.

The aim was to:
 - set the request
 - to get ride of the "CORS problem"
 - tprocess the answer of the request
 - implement a welcoming visual to received the data from the query, involving the manipulation of nested tables
 
 - style : bootstrap
